Exercise 1 - Testing your knowledge of functions
Answer the below questions
What is a function in Python? A block of organized, resuable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Provide better modularity for your appliction and a high degree of code reusing.  Gives you many built in like print(), etc. Create y 
your own fucntions. 
What are the advantages of using functions? Adavantages of using functions are; reducing duplicate of code. Decomposing complex problems int simpler pieces. 

Exercise 2 - Max of three numbers
Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [10]:
### YOUR CODE GOES 
# Python Program - Find Largest of Three Numbers
	
while True:
	print("Enter 'x' for exit.")
	print("Enter any three numbers: ")
	num1 = input()
	num2 = input()
	num3 = input()
	if num1 == 'x':
		break
	else:
		number1 = int(num1)
		number2 = int(num2)
		number3 = int(num3)
		largest = number1
		if largest < number2:
			if number2 > number3:
				largest = number2
			else:
				largest = number3
		elif largest < number3:
			if number3 > number2:
				largest = number3
			else:
				largest = number2
		else:
			largest = number1
		print("Largest of given three numbers is",largest,"\n")

### END CODE
Exercise 3 - Finding the sum of numbers in a list
Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [11]:
### YOUR CODE GOES BELOW
def sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    return total
print(sum((8, 2, 3, 0, 7)))

# ASSUMING PYTHON3

user_input = input("Enter a list of numbers, comma-separated\n>> ")
user_input_as_list = user_input.split(",")
user_input_as_numbers_in_list = map(float, user_input_as_list) # maybe int?
# This will fail if the user entered any input that ISN'T a number

def sum(lst):
    accumulator = 0
    for element in lst:
        accumulator += element
    return accumulator

### END CODE
Exercise 4 - Finding the product of numbers in a list
Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [12]:
### YOUR CODE GOES BELOW
>>> import operator
>>> numbers = range(1, 11)
>>> numbers
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> reduce(operator.mul, numbers)
3628800

Exercise 5 - Reversing a String
Write a Python function to reverse a string
Make sure you invoke this function in your main program and display the result
In [5]:
### YOUR CODE GOES BELOW
def reverse(string):
    if len(string) == 0:
        return string
    else:
        return reverse(string[1:]) + string[0]
a = str(input("Enter the string to be reversed: "))
print(reverse(a))
